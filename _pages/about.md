Hi, I'm Jordan. Welcome to my blog.

I plan on sharing things I have learned over my many years working in technology and software engineering. I will probably even post some trainings and talks here as well.

I am currently a Staff Platforms Engineer on the Platform Architecture team at [FMG](https://fmgsuite.com), but anything I write about is solely my own opinion.

In addition to software and technology, I may post about other topics from time to time. I try to blend my interests when possible, which has led to some hybrid hobbies like DIY modular synthesizers or using computers to generate music.

I hope you enjoy your time here. Please contact me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jcleigh) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/jcleigh) if you have any comments, questions, or feedback.
